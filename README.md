##  About

This project was one of many little projects I wrote while teaching myself Python from scratch.  

It provides a visual illustration of the following sorting algorithms:
- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort

Code 100% my own, and was based entirely on verbal descriptions of how each algorithm works, which I found on the [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) website.

No AI was used.

## How to Use

- **Left mouse button** â€” Select a cell in the array for editing
- **Left/right arrow keys** â€” Move the cell selection box left/right
- **Left/right arrow keys** â€” Increment/decrement the currently selected cell
- **Number keys** â€” Enter a numerical value directly into the selected cell
- **Backspace key** â€” Delete the selected cell's value, making it 0
- **'Sort' button on the GUI** â€” Sort the array using the selected algorithm
- **'Reset' button on the GUI** â€” Make the array editable again after having sorted it
- **'Clear' button on the GUI** â€” Clear the array, filling all cells with 0s
- **Dropdown menu on the GUI** â€” Select between the four sorting algorithms
